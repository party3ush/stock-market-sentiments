# Title: Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and BERT Transformer Model

## Abstract:

Accurate prediction of stock market sentiment is crucial for informed decision-making by investors and financial analysts. In this research study, we explore the application of various machine learning (ML) models to analyze sentiment in stock market data. We employ five traditional ML models and leverage advanced deep learning techniques, including the powerful Transformer model, BERT.

Our research aims to compare the performance of these models in accurately predicting stock market sentiment. We evaluate their performance using commonly used evaluation metrics and analyze their strengths and weaknesses based on interpretability, robustness to noise, and ability to capture complex patterns in the text data.

Among the models tested, BERT using TF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 83%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of BERT in capturing nuanced sentiment in stock market data. Additionally, we provide insights into the interpretability of the models, their resilience to noisy data, and their capacity to detect complex patterns.

The findings of this research contribute to the field of stock market sentiment analysis by highlighting the potential of both traditional ML models and advanced deep learning techniques. The comparison and evaluation of these models provide valuable guidance to investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions based on sentiment analysis of stock market data.
